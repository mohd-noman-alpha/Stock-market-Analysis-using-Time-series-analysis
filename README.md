ðŸ“ˆ Stock Market Analysis using Time Series Analysis
I'm interested in leveraging time series analysis for stock market forecasting, utilizing methods such as:

Trend Analysis: Using moving averages to spot long-term trends.
Seasonality Detection: Recognizing recurring patterns with STL decomposition.
Volatility Analysis: Capturing volatility clustering through GARCH models.
Autocorrelation: Using ACF and PACF to reveal dependencies in price movements.
Forecasting Models: ARIMA for trend-based forecasting, and LSTM for capturing complex patterns in stock prices.
Time series analysis enhances market insights, aiding in better decision-making for trading strategies. ðŸ“Š
